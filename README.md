# Ecomm_customer_segmentation
An e-commerce customer segmentation project using RFM analysis for targeted marketing strategies.

This repository contains a data science project focused on customer segmentation for an e-commerce business. The project leverages the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. By identifying distinct segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies for more effective customer engagement.

# Overview
Customer segmentation is a critical aspect of marketing strategy, allowing businesses to understand and target different customer groups effectively. This project explores the RFM framework, which considers three key factors:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.
Monetary Value (M): How much money a customer spends.
Using these metrics, we analyze and cluster customers to uncover valuable insights for marketing campaigns.
